# RayTracer
This is a toy project and a trip down memory lane. One of my first projects in CPE101 was to design a simple ray tracer that took in sphere and color information.
It was single threaded and written in python 2.7. It was slow, clunky and exactly what you would expect from a 101 project. Half the code was written by the professor as "something to get you started".

The goal of this repo is to take that original code and rewrite it in several languages, mainly: python with multithreading, cython, c, and rust. How long that will take is an open question.

The purpose of this project is to learn languages I don't normally work in, and design patterns for handling a mono repo with multilanguages. Plus its fun to see old code run faster!
